# 0_1-MKP-Heuristic
This repository contains the code and the results of the dissertation project:\
***A Greedy Heuristic to Solve 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem: An Application to Asset Management in the Water Industry***, presented by Jarold Montes\
\
The repository containts the following files:
* **01_MKP_Heuristic.ipynb**, containts the python code with the heuristic
* **data**, contains the dataset1 and dataset2, list of tests and the optimal solutions
* **results_dataset1**, contains the results given by the heuristic with dataset 1. It features a cvs file with a summary of the results and subfolders with results with adjustment and without adjustment steps. Each test is indentified with the RHS of the constraints.
* **results_dataset1**, contains the results given by the heuristic with dataset 2. It features a cvs file with a summary of the results and subfolders with results with adjustment and without adjustment steps. Each test is indentified with the RHS of the constraints.
* **xpress_model**, constains xpress model used to get optimal solutions
