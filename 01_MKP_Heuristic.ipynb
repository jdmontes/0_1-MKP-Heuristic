    "## Heuristics\n",
    "This section contains the code of the heuristics, which is based on an algorithm that assigns points to each pipe depending on how efficient they are to close the feasibility gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**feasibility gap** is the difference between the actual value of the constraint and their target value. If the difference is less or equal than zero, which means that the constraint is not being violated, the feasibility gap is zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each constraint parameter, namely burst rate, leakage rate and average supply interruption time, the points are calculated as the pipe parameter value divided by the sum of the parameter value of all pipes. For instance, the burst rate points for pipe ***i*** would be:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>$br\\:points\\:i = \\frac{burst\\: rate\\: of\\: pipe\\: i}{sum\\:burst\\:rate\\:all\\:not\\:selected\\:pipes}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the total points for each pipe properly, we must find the weights for each constraint parameter. The logic behind the weights relays on how \"easy\" filling the gap is. We measure the easiness as the ratio between the feasibility gap and the 90th quantile of constraint parameter. As we expect to fill the feasibility gap with the pipes that hold the highest values of constraints' parameters, the 90th quantile seems to be a sensible approximation of the easiness. Finally, the weights are adjusted to sum up one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the weighted sum of the points is calculated and divided by the cost of replacing the pipe. This will give us a ranking with the more efficient pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting the last pipe, we don't want to select the pipe with the highest rank (based on the point rank depicted before), but the pipe able to fill the final gap at the lowest price. Therefore, an alternative ranking is made to select this pipe and make the heuristic more efficient.\n",
